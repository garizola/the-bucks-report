## Thoughts

Game three in Boston was very competitive in the first half. Both teams played hard and it showed. The Bucks looked determined to get back on track with a win against the reigning NBA champions.

Doc Rivers had an interesting defensive game plan for the starting lineup in this one. Giannis was on Jrue Holiday, Lillard on White, Trent Jr. on Tatum, and Price on Brown. At first, it seemed a bit odd, but eventually, I grew confident in the decision. It was also clear that regardless of the half-court defensive assignments, the Celtics were going to push the ball in transition as often and as quickly as possible. This proved to be challenging to defend for the Bucks throughout the game.

Overall, I was not disappointed by anyoneâ€™s play in the first half. However, things took a turn in the third quarter and what stood out to me was how the Celtics used the Bucks fouls to their advantage. Their ability to draw fouls and get easy points was evident. When you consider the six additional fouls and four more turnovers the Bucks had compared to the Celtics, it makes you wonder if those extra possessions or free throw opportunities could have led to a closer result. The real morale killer was the Celtics' sixth man, Payton Pritchard, who had an incredible game, shooting 8 of 12 from deep. The Bucks three point halftime lead quickly vanished when the Celtics outscored them by 11 points in the third quarter. It seemed like the Bucks effort and tenacity dropped a level or two after that, causing the game slipped out of reach.

On another note, a second-half skid seems to be a recurring issue for the Bucks. They dropped 12 points to the Bulls in the second half and by 10 points to the Nets. I would love to see the same tenacity from the first half carry over to the second in future games. 
I fully expect the team to figure things out and get back on track. With Kris being day-to-day and nearing a return, I expect the team will gain a great confidence boost upon his return. 

The Grizzlies are up next for the Bucks. The game will take place October 31st in Memphis.
