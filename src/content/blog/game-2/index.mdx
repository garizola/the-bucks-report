## Thoughts

The Bucks’ home opener was slightly disappointing. Offensively, the team played well, with Taurean Prince and Gary Trent Jr. combining for an average USG% of 10, almost identical to last game. Both players were extremely effective on offense again, posting offensive ratings of 124 (Trent Jr.) and 170 (Prince), leading the rest of the starters. Delon and A.J. also had efficient nights, with ratings of 188 and 211, respectively.

We saw plenty of Dame and Brook pick-and-roll situations on Friday. These plays were less effective against the athletic Bulls defense. Coby White, while nearly reaching a career-high in points, had a solid defensive performance, holding Lillard to 28 points on 3-of-12 shooting from behind the arc and achieving a defensive rating of 107. Dame did finish with an impressive 8-of-9 from inside the arc.

Overall, the Bucks offense was not bad. Brook Lopez’s continues to struggle shooting the ball. His offensive rating has dropped to 68, bringing his season average to 75. He is just 2-of-12 from three on the season. His missed shots were noticeably off-target. He is also 3-of-9 from inside, which is disappointing for a center.

Giannis and Dame are both playing at a high level offensively. Each putting up great offensive ratings. A few costly turnovers from the pair destroyed any chance of a comeback late in the game. While I'm not overly concerned, it's still frustrating, nonetheless. Perhaps expectedly, Giannis was the only Buck to miss a free throw, going 8-for-16 from the line.

The big story of this game was the Chicago Bulls offense. Making 21 of 47 threes, they were shooting the ball very well. For most of the game, they shot well above 50%, with the starters making 17 of 35 attempts. 

There isn’t much you can do when a team is shooting as well as the Bulls were. However, a few Bucks significantly struggled on defense. Dame had difficulty keeping anyone in front of him, posting a defensive rating of 129 (a lower defensive rating is better). Last season, something Doc Rivers emphasized to start the season, was Brook Lopez not having to leave the paint. With Nikola Vucevic shooting 4-of-9 from deep, Brook was forced to step out. When he leaves the paint, we see more players cut, get open, and passing lanes expand. The team’s defensive rotations tend to struggle with Brook on the court and this is an area I’d like to see improved over the course of the season.

I’m looking forward to tomorrow’s matchup in Brooklyn against the Nets.
