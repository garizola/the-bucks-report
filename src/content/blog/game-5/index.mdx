## Thoughts

Game 5 was not good to say the least. From the opening tip to the final whistle, the team's effort was subpar. Giannis was essentially the Bucks only offensive contributor, posting a 138 offensive rating. Damian Lillard played 33 minutes but only scored 4 points on 12 field goal attempts. Brook Lopez had a respectable 133 offensive rating, but with only a 15.8% usage rate, he managed just 12 points, hitting three of his six attempts from deep.

Giannis recorded a plus/minus of 0, leading the top six players, who together (minus Giannis) averaged a disappointing -25.6 plus/minus. There isn’t much positive to say about the team’s overall performance. Ja Morant and the Grizzlies seemed to get whatever they wanted on the floor, scoring 68 points in the paint and out rebounding the Bucks by 17. Despite a modest 28.6% shooting from three, the Grizzlies got to the free-throw line 31 times, scoring 28 of those attempts. The Bucks fouling issues continue, with six more fouls than the Grizzlies.

The team falls to 1-4 with the loss, placing them second to last in the East. The Bucks urgently need to turn things around and find ways to improve their defense, off-ball offense, and transition play. Giannis continues to perform at an MVP level, but it doesn’t seem like his play alone, no matter how outstanding, can change the outcomes of these games.

The Bucks take on the red-hot Cleveland Cavaliers team in Milwaukee on November 2nd.
