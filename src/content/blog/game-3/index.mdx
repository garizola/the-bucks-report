## Thoughts

Game three in Brooklyn was rather frustrating. There were five turnovers in the first eight minutes, and there was no intensity either. Overall, I don’t think anyone played well, with poor defensive and offensive ratings posted across the board. I don’t think anyone who follows NBA basketball would say that the Brooklyn Nets are great or even solid. Not to discredit the Nets, but a loss is disappointing.  The Bucks made Nic Claxton and Dennis Schroder look like MVP candidates. Claxton finished with five offensive rebounds in 21 minutes of play. Schroder was 5/8 from behind the arc, with virtually none of his shots being contested.

The Nets main rotation all played well and for the second game in a row, the Bucks' defense gave up a 32+ points to opposing player. The biggest issues continue to be defensive rotations, closing out, and on-ball defense. I would say all aspects of defense need improvement, besides rebounding. There isn’t much else to say. The Bucks are not the most athletic team, and that is no secret, but there needs to be some sort of game plan when they play teams that are. They also don’t have a great on-ball defender. Someone the team can rely on to guard the opposing team’s best scorer. Giannis has consistently shown he can defend at a high level, but there isn’t a perimeter defender who can provide that same level of defense. Historically, Dame has been mediocre on defense, but in these first few games of the season, he has been a liability.

The Bucks' offense was poor as well. Scoring 102 points isn’t going to win games. There was a solid run when the bench unit came in, which helped the score. Alongside the high turnover rate, the Bucks didn’t move the ball much at all. Quick, contested shots were the theme of the night.

The Bucks travel to Boston to take on the former NBA Champion Boston Celtics next. The team drastically needs a bounce back victory.
